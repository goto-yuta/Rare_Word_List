mind like a sponge
pick and shovel work
put up a good front
skate close to the edge
twist someone around your little finger
wrap up loose ends
a fine state of affairs
bark is bigger than their bite
kick at the cat
lie like a dog
put up a good face
squashed in like sardines
cook the accounts
full of bologna
have a buzz on
have two bites of the apple
hit a happy medium
in the bat of an eye
kick around an idea
knock down a notch
make up the couch
mind like a sieve
muff your lines
quake like a leaf
quiet as a cat
rub someone's fur the wrong way
twist your rubber arm
wind someone around your little finger
clear up loose ends
cut your eyeteeth on
have a stormy brow
lay down on the job
send for a loop
sleep like a top
take your belt in a notch
toot your own whistle
wear a stormy brow
your eyes are bigger than your belly
